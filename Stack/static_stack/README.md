# Project's struct
- `static_stack.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the stack, the pointer "stack", the array size and function prototypes.
- `static_stack.c`: Definition of the data types "stack", implementation of the functions.
	- `main.c`: Management of the user interface and input/output (I/O) operations.
- `static_stack_test.c`: Implementation of the test functions.
	- `main_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of static stack.
	
• Static stack: A type of "stack" in which the successor of an element ocupy it next physical position (array use).
