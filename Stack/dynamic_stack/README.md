# Project's struct
- `dynamic_stack.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the stack, the pointer "stack" and function prototypes.
- `dynamic_stack.c`: Definition of the data types "stack", implementation of the functions.
	- `main.c`: Management of the user interface and input/output (I/O) operations.
- `dynamic_stack_test.c`: Implementation of the test functions.
	- `main_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of dynamic stack.
	
• Dynamic stack: A type of "stack" in which each element points it successor. Uses a special pointer (double pointer) for the first element and an indicator for the end.
