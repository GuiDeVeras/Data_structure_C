# Project's struct
- `sequential_list.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the list, the pointer "list", the length of the array and function prototypes.
- `sequential_list.c`: Definition of the data types "list", implementation of the functions.
- `sequential_list_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of static sequential list.
	
• Static sequential list: A type of list in which the successor of an element occupy their next physical position (usage of an array).
