# Project's struct
- `sequential_list.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the list, the pointer "list" and function prototypes.
- `sequential_list.c`: Definition of the data types "list", implementation of the functions.
- `sequential_list_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of dynamic linked list.
