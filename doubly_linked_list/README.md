# Project's struct
- `doubly_list.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the list, the pointer "list" and function prototypes.
- `doubly_list.c`: Definition of the data types "list", implementation of the functions.
	-`main.c`: Management of the user interface and input/output (I/O) operations.
- `doubly_list_test.c`: implementation of the test functions.
	- `main.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of doubly linked list.
	
• Doubly linked list: A type of list in which each element points to your successor and predecessor in the list. It uses an especial pointer for the first element and the last element, in both directions.
