# Project's struct
- `circular_list.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the list, the pointer "list" and function prototypes.
- `circular_list.c`: Definition of the data types "list", implementation of the functions.
	-`main.c`: Management of the user interface and input/output (I/O) operations.
- `circular_list_test.c`: Implementation of the test functions.
	- `main_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of doubly linked list.
	
• Circular linked list: A type of list in which each element points to your successor and the last element points to the first. It uses an especial pointer for the first element and there isn't an indication of list's end .
