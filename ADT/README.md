# Project's struct
- `Point.h`: Definition of ADT Point and function prototypes.
- `Point.c`: Implementation of the point mathematical logic.
- `Point_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.



	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of modularization and ADT.
	
•Modularity
	It's the division of a system into separate modules or components. Each module handles a specific functionality and operates independently.

•ADT
	It's the operations to manipulate data.
	Ex.:
	-Struct creation
	-Element inclusion
	-Element remotion
	-Access to an element
