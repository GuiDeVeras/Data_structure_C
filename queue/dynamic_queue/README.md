# Project's struct
- `dynamic_queue.h`: Definition of the data type stored in the queue, the pointer "queue" and function prototypes.
- `dynamic_queue.c`: Definition of the data types "queue", implementation of the functions.
	- `main.c`: Management of the user interface and input/output (I/O) operations.
- `dynamic_queue_test.c`: Implementation of the test functions.
	- `main_test.c`: Unitary test for validate the creation and manipulation.

	The purpose of this project is to learn the applications of dynamic queue.
